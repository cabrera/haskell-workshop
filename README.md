# Haskell Workshop

Goal: Learn how to Haskell!

These workshop materials are a work in progress. Included are:

* Handouts: resources, cookbook, syntax
* Code: list shifter module

## Handouts

The handouts attempt to compress a lot of information into a single
place. The focus on the early handouts was to cover the less obvious
aspects of Haskell programming - how does one read a file, etc..

## Code

### List Shifter

It's a simple project - given four type signatures and four undefined
functions, work together to implement those operations. Includes
testing, project set up (cabal), and basic modularization.

It's a minimal project to cover much of the Haskell development flow.
